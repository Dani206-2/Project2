## The function Pone, aims to calculate the probability of an individual  
## prisoner finding their own number in n tries. Depending on the chosen 
## strategy, Pone generates a sequence of the boxes the prisoner is going 
## through, along with the corresponding card numbers.
 

## Inputs: n: the number of prisoners, k: the prison number 
## strategy: 3 strategies to choose, nreps.nreps: number of simulations, the 
## default value is set to 10,000.

## Output: probability of success for the chosen strategy for an individual
## prisoner.

## The function Pone is defined right after, the (sub)function Psub, which is 
## utilized in the definition of Pone

## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The function Psub, aims to minimize the overlap between the function Pone
## and  the function Pall, which is defined later on.
## Inputs: n,k,strategy and a 2n-vector cardseq representing the sequence of
## cards in the corresponding boxes, i.e cardseq[k] is the number of the card
## contained in the box k.
## Output: True if the prisoners finds his number for the given inputs, False
## otherwise.

## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  droop function aims to estimate, by simulation, the probability of each loop 
##  length from 1 to 2n occurring at least once in a random shuffling of cards 
##  to boxes.
##  Vector v.sim aims to store the frequency about each loop length from 1 to 2n
##  occurring at least once after replicating simulations 10000 times. 
##  We assume all cards that are not opened, and record it when card has been 
##  opened. In that case we could only test cards not opened and it will save 
##  lots of time. 
##  We value elements, index corresponding to the length of loop, in 
##  vector v.sim 1 if the length of loop occurred at least once, otherwise 0. 
##  For next simulation we just add new v.sim vector to previous one.
##  We get probability vector through dividing the v.sim by nreps.

##  Inputs:  n: the number of prisoners nreps:the number of replicate simulations
##  Output:  , the probability of each loop length from 1 to 2n occurring at 
##  least once in a random shuffling of cards to boxes.

##  We will use the Sys.time() command to measure the runtime of the entire code

## The probability of success is the same for every prisoner (under any 
## strategy), so without loss of generality we demonstrate for prisoner 1
