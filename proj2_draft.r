## The function Pone, aims to calculate the probability of an individual  
## prisoner finding their own number in n tries. Depending on the chosen 
## strategy, Pone generates a sequence of the boxes the prisoner is going 
## through, along with the corresponding card numbers.
 

## Inputs: n: the number of prisoners divided by 2, k: the prison number through 
## "..." notation, strategy: 3 strategies to choose, through "..." notation
## nreps: number of simulations, the default value is set to 10,000.

## Output: probability of success for the chosen strategy for an individual
## prisoner.

## The function Pone is defined right after, the (sub)function Psub, which is 
## utilized in the definition of Pone

## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The function Psub, aims to minimize the overlap between the function Pone
## and the function Pall, which is defined later on.

## Inputs: n,k,strategy and a 2n-vector cardseq representing the sequence of
## cards in the corresponding boxes, i.e cardseq[k] is the number of the card
## contained in the box k 

## Output: True if the prisoners finds his number for the given inputs 
## successfully, False otherwise.


## We will use the Sys.time() command to measure the runtime of the entire code

    }
    
    
    i<-1 ## Set the number of boxes opened to be 1
    
    ## If the card is not found and boxes opened is less than n
    while (card!=k & i<n){
      
      ## Update the card read by using the previous card number to find
      ## the corresponding box number
      card<-cardseq[card] 
      i<-i+1 ## Increase the count by 1
    }

## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The function Pall aims to calculate the probability of success for all the
## prisoners, i.e. the probability that every single prisoner finds their 
## number, under a given strategy.
## Inputs: n, nreps (same meaning as above)
## plus strategy through '...' notation
## Output: Probability that all the prisoners find their number for the given
## inputs.

## Demonstration

## For an individual prisoner
## The probability of success is the same for every prisoner (under any 
## strategy), so without loss of generality we demonstrate for prisoner 1


## Probability of success for prisoner 1, for n=5, under strategy=1,2,3

r_ind5=c()

for(i in 1:3){
   
      r_ind5<-c(r_ind5,Pone(n=5,k=1,strategy=i))

}

## Probability of success for prisoner 1, for n=50, under strategy=1,2,3


r_ind50=c()

for(i in 1:3){
   
      r_ind50<-c(r_ind50,(Pone(n=50,k=1,strategy=i)))

}

## For all prisoners
## Probability of success for all prisoners simultaneously, under 
## strategy=1,2,3

r_all5=c()

for(i in 1:3){
   
      r_all5<-append(r_all5,(Pall(n=5,strategy=i)))

}


r_all50=c()

for(i in 1:3){
   
      r_all50=append(r_all50,(Pall(n=50,strategy=i)))

}


## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## results : r_ind5 = 0.4959 0.4028 0.4943, r_ind50 = 0.4955 0.3808 0.4947
## r_all5 = 0.3598 0.0001 0.0013, r_all50 = 0.3127 0.0000 0.0000

## We observe that for the individual cases stretagies 1,3 give better results
## than strategy 2, which matches our theoretical expectations. To understand
## why that is consider the fact that for strategy=1,3 the theoretical 
## probability is 1/2 while for strategy 2 the prisoner can choose a loop that 
## does not contain their number, so in that case they are stuck, which is why
## intuitively the probability for strategy 2 is <1/2. The really surprising 
## result comes when we consider the probability of success for all the 
## prisoners combined. For strategies 2,3 the probabilities of every prisoner
## are independent, because of the random choice of boxes, which makes the 
## combined probability fall off to zero really fast as the number of prisoners
## increases. For strategy 1, we get a very high probabilty compared to the 
## other strategies, because the  individual probabilities of success are no
## longer independent, because we have to take in to account the underlying 
## permutation of boxes. This means that, if for example prisoner 1 finds their
## number then every other prisoner whose number lies on the same loop is also
## going to succeed in finding their number, so the individual successes are 
## not independent.
